# stocks-analysis

Overview of Project:

The goal of this analysis is to determine investment options for the clientâ€™s parents. In order to achieve this, stock values from 2017 and 2018 are examined using excel VBA. Using macros, an initial analysis script was developed and ran yielding the performances of each stock by year. Along with this, a text box demonstrating the length of time necessary to run each analysis was displayed. In addition to the initial code, a refactoring code was developed in order to compare to the length of time necessary for the analysis to occur. 

Results:
Based on the anlaysis of the stock values performances, it would be wise to invest into ENPH or RUN. From 2017 to 2018, they were the only values that did not deplete from 2017 to 2018 into the negative, in fact they increased between the two years.

In 2017 all stocks with the exception of TERP performed positivly, but depleted in value in 2018. TERP, while still in the red in 2018 did appear to be on the rise in performance, going from -7.2 to -5.0%. 

Finally, with regards to the code utilized for the analysis the refracory code ran faster than the orginal code.

Summary:

The advantage of utilizing the new refractory code is the increase in time required to run the analysis. However, one disadvantage to this is the difficulty in running the original code once refractory occurred. When returning to the document to run my previous code, there was some issues after the refractory code was established. The refractory code is smaller than the original code though, so that is another possible plus for utilizing a refractory code.
